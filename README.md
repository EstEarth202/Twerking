# Twerking (Twerk To Grow)
## Description
Twerk (repeatedly sneak) nearby crops to make them grow faster.

Based on the [Tree Growing Simulator mod by tterrag1098](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tree-growing-simulator),
which was included in the original Skyfactory mod pack.

## Details
The growth is simulated in a 7x7 area around the player. A block is chosen at
random, and if it contains a plant that can be grown, it will advance one stage.

Players can either repeatedly press the sneak key (fastest) or hold the sneak
key (slower, but doesn't hurt your finger).

Currently, Twerking only works on the following blocks:
- Wheat/seeds
- Potatoes
- Carrots
- Beetroot

## TODO
- Add saplings
- Add melons/pumpkins
- Add whatever else when it is requested
